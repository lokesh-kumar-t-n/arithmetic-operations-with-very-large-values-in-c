arithmetic-operations-with-very-large-values-in-C
The code here deals with the very large number of values in C (typically of any number of lengths).
The code is attached with a sample client file.
So that must give you an idea of what it is.
The algorithm of every implemented function is mentioned in the respective functions itself.
feel free to express yourself if you find any bugs.
